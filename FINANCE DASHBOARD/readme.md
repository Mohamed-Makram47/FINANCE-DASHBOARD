# Finance Dashboard  

This project is a practice application built using **React**. It is part of my learning journey to apply the concepts and skills I've learned in React, including:  
- Component-based architecture  
- State management  
- Routing and layout structure  

The project is structured to simulate a finance dashboard, featuring modular components such as a **Sidebar**, **Content**, and additional utilities.  

## Features  
- **React Functional Components**: Modular design for easy scalability.  
- **Responsive Layout**: Built with modern web design principles.  
- **Vite**: Leveraged for fast development and optimized builds.  

## Getting Started
